\noindent The report should consist of approximately 5--10 pages of text per person
including tables and excluding code and figures plus Appendix. Important 
parts of the code should be included in the  text.  The  full  source
code  should  be  put  into the  Appendix. (Hint/recommendation: students
are free to choose for the report a replication of some research papers). 

\section{Introduction (1--2 pages)}
Motivate and describe the statistical issue / research questions .
Be very brief and concise. 

\section{Theory and Design (1--2 pages)}
Describe the statistical theory that you implement and the corresponding 
algorithm(s) that was (were)  designed. Avoid  describing how  the  design  
was  produced,  rather,  show  different versions of the design if relevant.

\section{Implementation/Simulation}
Show the implementation. The goal of this section is to show and explain
the most important parts of  the code. Listing the code with highlighting
and possibly line numbering is essential. Explain the code by referring to
line numbers, function calls and variable names. Leave out trivial parts 
(initialization, parameter-tuning, etc...).

\section{Empirical Study/Testing}
Test your code with an empirical study. Describe the data you use, state 
the source and how the data was  prepared. Show  tests  of  final  code
version.  Tests may include  correct  input, incorrect  input,  special
cases  and  stress  tests etc. Method of testing will vary with the problem
at  hand. Present  the  empirical  results  of  your  analysis. Do  the
results  support  the theory?  If not, why? This section is very important.
Display the tests with this format:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input
    \item Expected Output
    \item Actual Output
    \item Comments
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion (1--2 pages)}
Shortly summarize your results and give an overall conclusion. State
potential problems and describe how the performance of the product 
compares to your expectations (or to state of the art).
